#Why DevOps & SRE is needed in the application release process
The application release process has become increasingly complex due to the demand for rapid delivery, scalability, and reliability. DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) address these challenges by streamlining workflows, fostering collaboration, and automating processes:

1)DevOps focuses on breaking down team members are isolated from the team itself  between development and operations teams to enable faster, more efficient product delivery. It emphasizes continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), automation, and collaboration to ensure smooth application rollouts.
2)SRE ensures system reliability and stability by applying software engineering principles to IT operations. It bridges the gap between development and operations by focusing on scalability, uptime, and error management.

Together, DevOps and SRE ensure faster releases with fewer errors while maintaining high system reliability.

#The challenges DevOps & SRE solves

#Challenges Solved by DevOps:

1)Manual Errors: Automation reduces human errors in repetitive tasks like testing and deployment.
2)Slow Delivery: By automating build, test, and deployment processes through CI/CD pipelines, DevOps accelerates delivery timelines.

#Challenge Solved by SRE:
Scalability Issues: SRE designs systems that scale without compromising reliability or performance.

#The tasks and responsibilities of a DevOps & SRE engineer

#Responsibilities of a DevOps Engineer:

1)CI/CD Implementation: Automate build, testing, and deployment pipelines to speed up application delivery.
2)Monitoring & Troubleshooting: Proactively monitor systems for issues and resolve technical or security problems in development environments.
3)Collaboration: Work closely with developers to integrate tools and processes that enhance productivity.

#Responsibilities of an SRE Engineer:
1) Incident Management 
i)When something goes wrong (like a system outage), SREs respond quickly to fix the issue.
ii)They identify the root cause of the problem, implement a solution, and document what happened so the same issue doesnâ€™t occur again.

2) Automation
i)SREs automate repetitive tasks like deploying software, scaling systems, or monitoring performance. This reduces manual work and ensures things run smoothly and efficiently.
ii)For example, they might create tools that automatically check if systems meet reliability goals or scale resources during high demand.
